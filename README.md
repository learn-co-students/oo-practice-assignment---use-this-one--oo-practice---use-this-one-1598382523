## Set Up
- *Do not fork this repo*
- Clone down the repo
- On your local machine, in terminal, run `git checkout -b firstNamelastInitial`
- Run `git branch` and make sure your name is the one highlighted instead of master
- Make the changes to your code for the deliverables
- Follow your git process
    - `git add .` to add all changes
    - `git commit -m "helpful message"`
    - `git push` which may give you a message including a more specific command to run; if it does, run that command. 

## General Feedback
- Your instances for testing are ON POINT
- Make sure you are testing all of your methods cause a couple weren't quite working and I have no doubt you could've solved those errors!
- The one bit of improvement is to really track what type of information you're looking at (so patients for instance is an array, so you can't check for equality between that and a patient instance)
- Since you've got a pretty solid handle on the content up to this point, move your testing to a `console.rb` file, create some new methods (maybe more complicated?) that you want to build out, test those and then start on a CLI in the `run.rb` file!
