## Set Up
- *Do not fork this repo*
- Clone down the repo
- On your local machine, in terminal, run `git checkout -b firstNamelastInitial`
- Run `git branch` and make sure your name is the one highlighted instead of master
- Make the changes to your code for the deliverables
- Follow your git process
    - `git add .` to add all changes
    - `git commit -m "helpful message"`
    - `git push` which may give you a message including a more specific command to run; if it does, run that command. 


## General Feedback
- Your code is neaaarly perfect (see note in patient.rb initialize)
- Since it seems like you have a great handle on the concepts so far, start to go beyond what is required. Think of your own methods and behaviors you'd want to see. Move the testing code to a console.rb file and use run.rb to build a CLI to use your classes! 
- Good job so far :)
