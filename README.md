## Set Up
- *Do not fork this repo*
- Clone down the repo
- On your local machine, in terminal, run `git checkout -b firstNamelastInitial`
- Run `git branch` and make sure your name is the one highlighted instead of master
- Make the changes to your code for the deliverables
- Follow your git process
    - `git add .` to add all changes
    - `git commit -m "helpful message"`
    - `git push` which may give you a message including a more specific command to run; if it does, run that command. 

## General Feedback
- Your file structure does not match! Please correct it so that your files are as follows:
    - `app/models/patient.rb`
    - `app/models/doctor.rb`
    - So there will be an `app` directory inside of the project directory, a `models` directory inside of the `app` directory and the files inside of the `models` folder. 
- The run methods you've created in patient.rb and doctor.rb are the beginnings of a CLI. Those should live in your run.rb file; not inside of the Doctor and Patient classes
