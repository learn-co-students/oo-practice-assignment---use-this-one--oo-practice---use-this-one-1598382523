## Set Up
- *Do not fork this repo*
- Clone down the repo
- On your local machine, in terminal, run `git checkout -b firstNamelastInitial`
- Run `git branch` and make sure your name is the one highlighted instead of master
- Make the changes to your code for the deliverables
- Follow your git process
    - `git add .` to add all changes
    - `git commit -m "helpful message"`
    - `git push` which may give you a message including a more specific command to run; if it does, run that command. 

## General Feedback
- Watch your code style; indenting and naming conventions to make your code easier to read! 
- Your class and instance methods are generally correct! Where your emphasis for practice and study should be the associations now, particularly the has_many model, in this case the Doctor model. Remember that in order to reference the instances that belong to it we need to go through the belongs_to model, or Patient in this case. 
- Try to update your code and lmk if you're ready to push later today and I can review your updates
