## Set Up
- *Do not fork this repo*
- Clone down the repo
- On your local machine, in terminal, run `git checkout -b firstNamelastInitial`
- Run `git branch` and make sure your name is the one highlighted instead of master
- Make the changes to your code for the deliverables
- Follow your git process
    - `git add .` to add all changes
    - `git commit -m "helpful message"`
    - `git push` which may give you a message including a more specific command to run; if it does, run that command. 


## General Feedback
- Excellent job! Based on your code, it appears you have a good grasp of everythingn we've covered up until this point. You also have great code style so it's very readable and will help you hit less errors. 
- Now that you've got a solid foundation, push yourself to move beyond the required deliverables. Move your current testing in run.rb to a console.rb file so you can use the run.rb to create a CLI. Think of your own (more complicated?) methods to add to the classes and then test in your console.rb file.
- Good job so far :)
