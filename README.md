## General Feedback
- You're on a great track! The one bit of misunderstanding I want to point out if how the has_many model references the belongs_to model (in this case, how a doctor knows about it's patients). Please make sure to go review that. 
- Otherwise your code is pretty clean, some small indenting errors, and a couple of places where I think you're trying to reference the right thing but doing it the wrong way (like 1xs and increase_impatience in patient.rb)
- Really good work so far! Keep practicing!
