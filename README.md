## Set Up
- *Do not fork this repo*
- Clone down the repo
- On your local machine, in terminal, run `git checkout -b firstNamelastInitial`
- Run `git branch` and make sure your name is the one highlighted instead of master
- Make the changes to your code for the deliverables
- Follow your git process
    - `git add .` to add all changes
    - `git commit -m "helpful message"`
    - `git push` which may give you a message including a more specific command to run; if it does, run that command. 


## General Feedback
- Your class and instance methods and variables follow the correct syntax; however I think naming them differently will help you stay clear on what should be held in them. 
- The main thing that I'm noticing misunderstanding of is how to associate methods, and the importance of using a reference to the whole instance instead of an attribute (like name). Having access to the whole instances means that we can access any of its attributes or methods! 
- Definitely also go over what enumerables you should know at this point so that you are better able to think of which one is most appropriate for a given behavior.
- Make sure you're testing your code! Send me some screenshots of what was going on with pry. I left a comment with one tip if there weren't any errors coming up; binding.pry just wasn't putting you into the IRB.
