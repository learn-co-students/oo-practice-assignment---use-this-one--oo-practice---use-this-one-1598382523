## Set Up
- *Do not fork this repo*
- Clone down the repo
- On your local machine, in terminal, run `git checkout -b firstNamelastInitial`
- Run `git branch` and make sure your name is the one highlighted instead of master
- Make the changes to your code for the deliverables
- Follow your git process
    - `git add .` to add all changes
    - `git commit -m "helpful message"`
    - `git push` which may give you a message including a more specific command to run; if it does, run that command. 


## General Feedback
- You've got a random folder `ruby-oo-self-person...` inside of your file structure..? You can get rid of that
- Your basics of associations are pretty solid so far. See some notes in both files for ways to improve, including not writing duplicate code and know when to pass an instance versus a name string. 
- Be careful of your syntax; syntax errors can take up a lot of the time during the assessment, thereby making you unable to complete all of the deliverables!
