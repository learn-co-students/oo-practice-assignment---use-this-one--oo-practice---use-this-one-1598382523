## Set Up
- *Do not fork this repo*
- Clone down the repo
- On your local machine, in terminal, run `git checkout -b firstNamelastInitial`
- Run `git branch` and make sure your name is the one highlighted instead of master
- Make the changes to your code for the deliverables
- Follow your git process
    - `git add .` to add all changes
    - `git commit -m "helpful message"`
    - `git push` which may give you a message including a more specific command to run; if it does, run that command. 

## General Feedback
- File structure - `doctors.rb` should be singular `doctor.rb`! When we get to ActiveRecord in Week2 this would create errors for you! Please fix it :) 
- A lot of how you've associated the models are correct. See notes in `doctor.rb` for how to update the methods from Part III and finish out `patient.rb`
- You started to test but I can tell you didn't run the file because you'd get errors immediately! Go ahead and actually run your tests and debug why the file is broken. Hints in the `run.rb` file as well as a reminder that computers are real dumb.
