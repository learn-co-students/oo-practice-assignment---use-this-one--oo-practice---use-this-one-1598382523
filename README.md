## Set Up
- *Do not fork this repo*
- Clone down the repo
- On your local machine, in terminal, run `git checkout -b firstNamelastInitial`
- Run `git branch` and make sure your name is the one highlighted instead of master
- Make the changes to your code for the deliverables
- Follow your git process
    - `git add .` to add all changes
    - `git commit -m "helpful message"`
    - `git push` which may give you a message including a more specific command to run; if it does, run that command. 


## General Feedback
- In general your code is spot on! You've got a couple of typos
- The main thing I want you to change is about your code style; re-order what's in your classes so it's readable and the most important information is at the top and accessible for your future self and other developers
- Since you've got a pretty good handle on what we've learned to date now you should take it further! Move what's in your `run.rb` to a `console.rb` file so you can make a CLI in `run.rb` and test in the console file. Then build new methods (maybe more complicated ones) to push yourself!
