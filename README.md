## Set Up
- *Do not fork this repo*
- Clone down the repo
- On your local machine, in terminal, run `git checkout -b firstNamelastInitial`
- Run `git branch` and make sure your name is the one highlighted instead of master
- Make the changes to your code for the deliverables
- Follow your git process
    - `git add .` to add all changes
    - `git commit -m "helpful message"`
    - `git push` which may give you a message including a more specific command to run; if it does, run that command. 

## General Feedback
- Overall the code is functional, but the readability could be improved signficantly. 
- Since this is your second time through, definitely do more testing, create more methods of your own inspiration, and even begin the CLI.
