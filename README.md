## Set Up
- *Do not fork this repo*
- Clone down the repo
- On your local machine, in terminal, run `git checkout -b firstNamelastInitial`
- Run `git branch` and make sure your name is the one highlighted instead of master
- Make the changes to your code for the deliverables
- Follow your git process
    - `git add .` to add all changes
    - `git commit -m "helpful message"`
    - `git push` which may give you a message including a more specific command to run; if it does, run that command. 


## General Feedback
- Watch your syntax; particularly where you place your end's should be on their own line and indented to match where the corresponding code block started (ie def/end indented to match each other)
- Your current usage of the `self` keyword is correct! 
- Remember everything beneath the `private` keyword will be private. All methods that should not be private must be written above that keyword. 
- Try updating your syntax and then adding the behavior from Part III before moving on !
