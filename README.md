## Set Up
- *Do not fork this repo*
- Clone down the repo
- On your local machine, in terminal, run `git checkout -b firstNamelastInitial`
- Run `git branch` and make sure your name is the one highlighted instead of master
- Make the changes to your code for the deliverables
- Follow your git process
    - `git add .` to add all changes
    - `git commit -m "helpful message"`
    - `git push` which may give you a message including a more specific command to run; if it does, run that command. 


## General Feedback
- Your file structure is almost there! There should not be an `example_directory`. Instead `app` should be inside of your project directory (same level as this file), `models` should be inside of `app` and the files should be inside of `models`. Just remove the nesting inside of `example_directory` and then delete that folder. 
- You can also delete `filename.rb`
- Make sure you're testing your code in `run.rb` by making a CLI and in `console.rb` to just test out methods 
- Lots of notes in the files about the association. Your skills with class and instance methods and variables looks solid; time to focus on clarity around implemting associations.
