## Set Up
- *Do not fork this repo*
- Clone down the repo
- On your local machine, in terminal, run `git checkout -b firstNamelastInitial`
- Run `git branch` and make sure your name is the one highlighted instead of master
- Make the changes to your code for the deliverables
- Follow your git process
    - `git add .` to add all changes
    - `git commit -m "helpful message"`
    - `git push` which may give you a message including a more specific command to run; if it does, run that command. 


## General Feedback
- Your classes look clean and functional.
- Since the above is true and it seems you have a good grasp of the core concepts so far, take it farther! Start a console.rb file to test your methods and an CLI application in your run.rb file! Think of additional (and more complicated) methods to build out to push yourself and continue to grow!
- Good job so far :)
